# 💳 Luhn Algorithm in Python

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Luhn Algorithm**, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm. It's widely used to validate identification numbers like **credit card numbers**, **IMEIs**, and **national IDs**.

## 📘 What is the Luhn Algorithm?

The Luhn Algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate identification numbers. It works by performing a series of calculations on the digits of a number and checking whether the result meets a specific condition (usually that the total modulo 10 is 0).

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Validate a number using the Luhn check
- ✅ Generate a valid number with a correct Luhn check digit
- ✅ Clean and easy-to-read Python code
- ✅ CLI-friendly (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/luhn-algorithm-python.git
cd luhn-algorithm-python
```

### 2. Run the script

```bash
python3 luhn.py
```

---

## 🧠 Example Usage

### Validate a number

```python
from luhn import validate

print(validate("4539578763621486"))  # Output: True
print(validate("1234567812345670"))  # Output: False
```

### Generate a valid number

```python
from luhn import generate

print(generate("453957876362148"))  # Output: 4539578763621486
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
luhn-algorithm-python/
├── luhn.py        # Core logic for validation and generation
├── main.py        # (Optional) Command-line interface or testing
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

---

## ✅ Luhn Algorithm Steps (for validation)

1. Starting from the right, double every second digit.
2. If doubling results in a number > 9, subtract 9 from it.
3. Sum all the digits.
4. If the total modulo 10 is 0, the number is valid.
